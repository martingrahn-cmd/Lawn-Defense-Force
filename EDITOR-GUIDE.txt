2. GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

  Quick start:
    1. Click "LEVEL EDITOR" on the start screen
    2. Click "Generate" to create a starter neighborhood
    3. Use Select (V) to move/adjust objects
    4. Use Place (P) to add new objects from the palette
    5. Save your work with Ctrl+S

  The green ground plane is 200x200 units. You can build anywhere on it.
  The generated world uses about 120x120 units in the center, leaving
  plenty of room to expand.

================================================================================
3. BUILDING A WORLD STEP-BY-STEP
================================================================================

  PHASE 1: ROADS (the skeleton)
  ─────────────────────────────
  Roads define the structure of your neighborhood. Lay them first.

    a) Start with main roads. Place "road-road-straight" tiles in a line.
       - Each tile is 4x4 units, they snap together on the grid
       - Rotation 0 = road runs East-West (along X axis)
       - Rotation 90 = road runs North-South (along Z axis)

    b) Place intersections where roads meet:
       - "road-road-crossroad" for 4-way intersections
       - "road-road-intersection" for T-junctions
       - "road-road-curve" for 90-degree corners

    c) Add end pieces at dead ends:
       - "road-road-end-round" or "road-road-end"

    d) Optional: Add sidewalk variants (road-road-side, road-road-bend-sidewalk)

  PHASE 2: BUILDINGS (the bones)
  ──────────────────────────────
  Place houses facing the road, typically 14-16 units from road center.

    a) Choose house types from the "Buildings" category (21 types: a through u)
    b) Space houses ~8 units apart (building width)
    c) Rotate houses to face their nearest road:
       - Face +Z (south): rotation 0
       - Face -Z (north): rotation 180 (PI)
       - Face +X (east):  rotation -90
       - Face -X (west):  rotation 90
    d) Each house gets a unique colormap texture automatically in Generate.
       You can also manually cycle colors by re-placing a house.

  PHASE 3: INFRASTRUCTURE (connecting it)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
    a) Driveways: Place between road and house (~9 units from road center)
       - Use "driveway-long" or "driveway-short"
       - Rotate to point from road toward house

    b) Walkway paths: Place alongside driveways (~10-11 units from road center)
       - "path-short", "path-stones-short", "path-stones-messy" etc.

    c) Fences: Place in front of houses (~10 units from road center)
       - Mix "fence-1x4", "fence-1x3", "fence-2x3" for variety

  PHASE 4: VEHICLES (life on the road)
  ─────────────────────────────────────
    a) Park cars in driveways (same z-position as driveway, they sit on top)
    b) Park some cars along the road edge (~3 units from road center)
    c) Mix car types: sedan, suv, van, truck, taxi, police, hatchback
    d) Not every driveway needs a car! 60-70% feels natural.

  PHASE 5: NATURE (softening the geometry)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
    a) Sidewalk trees: Regular spacing (~6-8 units apart) along road edges
       - Alternate "tree-large" and "tree-small"
       - Jitter positions slightly (0.5-1 unit) for organic feel
       - Place ~6-7 units from road center

    b) Backyard trees: Random scatter behind houses (~18-24 units from road)
       - Less regular spacing, more organic clumps
       - Mix large and small trees

    c) Planters: Near house entrances for garden feel

  PHASE 6: DETAILS (what makes it "alive")
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    a) Traffic lights at intersections (diagonally placed, ~5 units from center)
    b) Road signs at neighborhood entries
    c) Construction zone: a few cones + barrier = instant story-telling
    d) Vary everything! No two houses should be identical.

================================================================================
4. ROAD SYSTEM (Kenney Road Kit)
================================================================================

  All road tiles are 4x4 units (scaled from Kenney's modular road kit).
  They snap together when grid snap is ON (default).

  CATEGORIES:
    Roads - Straight:
      road-road-straight .......... Basic straight road
      road-road-straight-barrier .. With guardrail
      road-road-side .............. Road with sidewalk on one side
      road-road-crossing .......... Pedestrian crossing
      road-road-end ............... Dead end (flat)
      road-road-end-round ......... Dead end (rounded)
      road-road-square ............ Road surface tile
      road-road-driveway-single ... Road with one driveway cutout
      road-road-driveway-double ... Road with two driveway cutouts

    Roads - Curves:
      road-road-bend .............. 90-degree turn
      road-road-bend-sidewalk ..... 90-degree turn with sidewalk
      road-road-curve ............. Curved turn
      road-road-curve-pavement .... Curved with pavement

    Roads - Intersections:
      road-road-crossroad ......... 4-way intersection
      road-road-intersection ...... T-junction
      road-road-split ............. Y-split
      road-road-roundabout ........ Roundabout
      road-road-side-entry ........ Side road entry
      road-road-side-exit ......... Side road exit

    Roads - Ramps:
      road-road-slant ............. Ramp up
      road-road-slant-flat ........ Ramp leveling off
      road-road-bridge ............ Bridge section

  ROTATION GUIDE:
    Use R to rotate 45 degrees. Road pieces typically need 0 or 90 degrees:
      0 degrees ... Road runs East-West (stripes along X axis)
      90 degrees .. Road runs North-South (stripes along Z axis)
      180 degrees . Flipped direction (for end pieces, entries)

================================================================================
5. BUILDINGS & COLOR VARIATION
================================================================================

  21 building types (building-a through building-u) using Kenney's
  Suburban Buildings kit. All share a colormap texture system.

  COLORMAPS:
    The game loads 4 colormap textures:
      - colormap.png (default)
      - variation-a.png
      - variation-b.png
      - variation-c.png

    When using "Generate", each house automatically gets a different
    colormap, cycling through all 4 variations. This gives houses
    different wall colors, roof colors, and trim colors.

  MANUAL COLOR CONTROL:
    Currently, colormap assignment happens during generation.
    To get different colors manually:
      1. Delete and re-place the house (it picks a new random type)
      2. Or: Use Generate as a starting point and rearrange

  DEFAULT BUILDING SCALE:
    Buildings are scaled so their X-dimension = 8 game units.
    Actual dimensions vary by type (some wider, some taller).

================================================================================
6. MAKING IT FEEL "ALIVE" - DETAIL CHECKLIST
================================================================================

  Use this checklist when building or reviewing a neighborhood block:

  [ ] Roads connect logically (no floating tiles, proper intersections)
  [ ] Every intersection has traffic lights (diagonally placed)
  [ ] Houses face the nearest road
  [ ] Mix of house types (don't repeat the same type in a row)
  [ ] Houses have varied colors (different colormap textures)
  [ ] Most houses have a driveway
  [ ] About 60% of driveways have a parked car
  [ ] A few cars parked on the street (not too many, not too few)
  [ ] Mix of car types (sedan, SUV, van, truck, taxi, etc.)
  [ ] Front fences between road and houses
  [ ] Sidewalk trees at regular intervals along every road
  [ ] Backyard trees scattered randomly behind houses
  [ ] Walkway paths from road to house entrance
  [ ] A few planters near house entrances
  [ ] At least one "story" element:
      - Construction zone (cones + barrier)
      - Police car parked at a house
      - A cluster of trees suggesting a small park
  [ ] Road signs at neighborhood entries
  [ ] No large empty areas without any objects
  [ ] Objects don't overlap badly (slight overlap is OK for fences/paths)

  DENSITY GUIDE (objects per suburban block of ~36x36 units):
    Houses ......... 6-8
    Cars ........... 4-6 (driveways) + 2-3 (street)
    Trees .......... 12-16 (sidewalk) + 6-8 (backyard)
    Fences ......... 6-8 segments
    Driveways ...... 6-8
    Paths .......... 6-8
    Planters ....... 2-4
    Traffic lights . 2 per intersection (diagonal corners)

================================================================================
7. SCALE REFERENCE & IMPORTED ASSETS
================================================================================

  PLAYER SIZE:
    The player character is approximately:
      Width:  0.6 units (body)
      Height: 1.65 units (feet to top of head)
      Radius: 0.4 units (collision)

    Toggle the player reference figure with T to see this in the editor.
    The red pole next to the player shows exactly 1 unit height.

  DEFAULT SCALES (auto-applied to known asset categories):
    Asset Type      Scaled To       Dimension
    ─────────────   ──────────────  ──────────
    Buildings       8 units wide    X
    Cars            2 units wide    X
    Trees           4 units tall    Y
    Fences          4 units wide    X
    Paths           2 units wide    X
    Driveways       3 units wide    X
    Planters        0.8 units tall  Y
    Road tiles      4 units wide    X
    Signs           3 units tall    Y
    Traffic lights  4 units tall    Y
    Construction    1.5 units tall  Y

  IMPORTING CUSTOM ASSETS:
    1. Drag-and-drop a .glb or .gltf file onto the editor canvas
       OR click "Import GLB" in the toolbar
    2. The model appears in the "Imported" category in the palette
    3. Imported models get scale = 1 (original size)

    SCALING IMPORTED ASSETS:
      a) Place the object
      b) Switch to Select (V) and click it
      c) Adjust Scale in the Properties panel (bottom right)
      d) Use the player reference (T) to judge correct size

    COMMON SCALE ISSUES:
      - Kenney assets: 1 unit ≈ 1 meter → usually correct at default scale
      - Sketchfab models: Often very large → try scale 0.01 to 0.1
      - Quaternius: Usually 1 unit ≈ 1 meter → correct at default
      - Blender default: 1 unit = 1 meter → usually correct

    TIPS:
      - A car should be about 2 units wide (same as player height)
      - A house should be about 4-8 units wide
      - A tree should be about 3-5 units tall
      - Road tiles should be 4 units to match the existing grid

================================================================================
8. SAVE/LOAD WORKFLOW
================================================================================

  SAVING:
    - Press Ctrl+S or click "Save"
    - Downloads a "level.json" file
    - Contains all placed objects with position, rotation, scale, and model name

  LOADING:
    - Click "Load" and select a .json file
    - Replaces all current objects with the loaded level
    - Only works with models that are currently loaded (built-in + imported)

  NOTE: Imported .glb models are NOT saved in the level file. If you
  load a level that uses imported models, you need to re-import those
  models first.

  RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
    1. Generate a base world
    2. Customize and add details
    3. Save frequently (Ctrl+S)
    4. Keep backups with descriptive names (level-v1.json, level-v2.json)

================================================================================
10. TIPS & TRICKS
================================================================================

  LAYOUT TIPS:
    - Real suburbs have houses on both sides of a road, facing the road
    - Stagger houses slightly (not perfectly aligned) for realism
    - Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs) create natural gameplay arenas
    - Open areas (parks, parking lots) are good for combat encounters

  PERFORMANCE:
    - The editor can handle 500+ objects comfortably
    - Very large worlds (1000+ objects) may slow down
    - Road tiles are simple geometry, so they're cheap

  GAMEPLAY CONSIDERATIONS:
    - The player needs open space to move and shoot (min ~3 unit gaps)
    - Enemies spawn at the map edges
    - Fences are destructible in-game (HP: 30)
    - Cars are destructible in-game
    - Houses are solid collision (not destructible)
    - Trees have no collision in-game

  AESTHETIC TIPS:
    - Variety is king: mix house types, car types, tree sizes
    - Break symmetry: don't mirror left and right sides exactly
    - Add "stories": a taxi parked at a house, cones near a pothole, etc.
    - Edge treatment: don't let roads/houses end abruptly at the map edge
    - Use the camera orbit (middle mouse) to check your world from game angle
